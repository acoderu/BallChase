"Optimize Sensor Synchronization: Allow for more flexibility in temporal alignment of measurements when sensor rates are inconsistent." 

Optimize Sensor Synchronization: Allow for more flexibility in temporal alignment of measurements when sensor rates are inconsistent.

Tune Process Noise Parameters: The process noise may need adjustment to better track moving objects, as the velocity estimates remain near zero.

Enable 2D-Only Tracking: Consider making the system less strict about requiring 3D sensors for tracking status when only 2D sensors are delivering fresh data.
