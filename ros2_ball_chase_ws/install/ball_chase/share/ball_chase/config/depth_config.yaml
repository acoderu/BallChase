# Configuration for the depth camera node - Basketball tracking

# Depth measurement parameters
depth:
  scale: 0.001           # Depth scale factor (converts raw depth to meters)
  min_depth: 0.1         # Minimum valid depth in meters
  max_depth: 8.0         # Maximum valid depth in meters
  radius: 6              # Increased radius around detection point for basketball (was 3)
  min_valid_points: 8    # Increased minimum valid points for reliable estimation (was 5)
  adaptive_radius: true  # Whether to try larger radius if not enough valid points
  max_radius: 10         # Increased maximum radius for basketball (was 7)
  calibration_file: "depth_camera_calibration.yaml"  # Path to calibration parameters
  detection_resolution:  # Resolution of detection images (YOLO/HSV)
    width: 320
    height: 320
  ball_diameter: 0.254   # Basketball diameter in meters (10 inches)
  min_height_from_ground: 0.0254  # Minimum expected height from ground (1 inch)
  max_height_from_ground: 0.254   # Max expected height from ground (10 inches - ball diameter)
  ground_tracking: true  # Enable specialized tracking for ground-based movement
